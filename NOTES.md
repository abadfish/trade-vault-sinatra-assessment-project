dateTime column might be a pain
be prepared to change the table
if I can't format the date correctly from the user

Do I want user to see their own trades only?
Or also see others' trades but only modify their own
Can there be a shared tradebook?

Aggregater. If you add to an existing position, the app adds it for you by editing the exisiting position
if @trade.product == Trade.find_by(params[:product])

-make tables for trades, with recent closing prices and current value

-chart trades?

-put which trader made the trades next to the trade.
